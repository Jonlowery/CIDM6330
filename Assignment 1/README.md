- **Version:** 1.0

### Introduction
This document outlines the requirements specification for a software system aimed at streamlining trade settlement and execution between front and back office operations. It builds upon the initial problem definition and domain analysis provided in Assignment 0.

#### Problem Statement
Modern banking and financial services, especially within capital markets, face delays, compliance risks, and increased operational overhead due to gaps in communication and manual processes during trade execution and settlement. This system is designed to reduce these inefficiencies by providing a unified, automated solution.

#### Domain of Practice
The solution is situated in the **banking and financial services** domain, focusing on **capital markets and institutional trading** where high transaction volume, strict regulatory compliance, and global operations create unique challenges.

#### Personal/Professional Interest
With professional experience in both investment strategy analysis and settlements clearance management, I have witnessed firsthand how critical efficient and transparent trade processing is to reducing operational risks and ensuring regulatory compliance.

#### System Overview
The proposed system is a Trade Execution and Management Platform that:
- Enhances real-time trade visibility.
- Automates key processes from trade capture to settlement.
- Ensures compliance with regulatory requirements.
- Improves collaboration among front office, middle office, and back office teams.

## Requirements Statements

### User Stories
- **User Story 1:**  
  *As a trader, I want to capture trade details in real-time so that I can execute trades accurately and efficiently.*

- **User Story 2:**  
  *As a compliance officer, I want the system to automatically validate and log trade data so that I can ensure adherence to regulatory standards.*

- **User Story 3:**  
  *As an operations analyst, I want to receive immediate alerts for any settlement exceptions so that I can quickly address issues.*

### Use Cases

#### Use Case 1: Trade Capture
- **Primary Actor:** Trader
- **Description:** The trader enters trade details into the system.
- **Preconditions:** The trader is authenticated.
- **Postconditions:** The trade details are recorded and forwarded for validation.
- **Basic Flow:**
  1. The trader logs into the system.
  2. The trader accesses the Trade Capture module.
  3. The trader inputs trade details (instrument type, quantity, price, etc.).
  4. The system creates a trade confirmation from Bloomberg and transmits it to the customer. 
  5. The system confirms receipt and sends the data for validation.
- **Alternate Flow:**  
  - If the input data is invalid, the system prompts the trader to correct the errors.

#### Use Case 2: Trade Validation
- **Primary Actor:** Middle Office Operator
- **Description:** Validate trade details for compliance and risk.
- **Preconditions:** Trade details have been captured.
- **Postconditions:** The trade is either confirmed for settlement or flagged for further review.
- **Basic Flow:**
  1. The middle office operator reviews the captured trade details.
  2. The system automatically runs compliance and risk checks.
  3. If the trade passes, it is confirmed; if not, it is flagged.
- **Alternate Flow:**  
  - If the trade fails automated checks, a manual review process is initiated.

### Features
- **Feature 1: Trade Capture Module:**  
  Real-time entry of trade data by front office personnel.
  
- **Feature 2: Middle Office Validation:**  
  Automated risk and compliance checks to validate trades.
  
- **Feature 3: Back Office Settlement Engine:**  
  Automation of post-trade settlement activities including clearing and ledger updates.
  
- **Feature 4: Data Integration Layer:**  
  Aggregates and synchronizes data from external market feeds and legacy systems.
  
- **Feature 5: Analytics & Reporting Dashboard:**  
  Provides real-time and scheduled reports on trade performance and compliance.
  
- **Feature 6: Alerting and Notification System:**  
  Proactively informs relevant stakeholders of exceptions or delays in the trade process.

### Gherkin Validation

```gherkin
Feature: Trade Capture Validation
  Scenario: Successful Trade Capture
    Given a trader is logged into the system
    When the trader enters valid trade details
    Then the system should record the trade and forward it for validation

Feature: Trade Validation Process
  Scenario: Trade Passes Compliance Check
    Given a trade is submitted for validation
    When the system performs automated risk and compliance checks
    Then the trade should be confirmed and moved to the settlement stage
```

## Specifications

### Concept
The Trade Execution and Management Platform is designed to streamline and automate the trade lifecycleâ€”from initial trade capture to final settlement.
